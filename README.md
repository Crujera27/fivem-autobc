This is the first script I ever published. Remember this is redistribute under the GNU GPLv3 license.
You can easily configure it.



Whats this will do?

This will send message to you server chat every X time you put in the config.

How to install?

Download the script in the release tab of this repository. Click the version that you wish.Unzip the folder, after of that drag and drop the folder in to the resources folder. If you put in in a folder that dosn't start when the server starts add this to you server.cfg

ensure crujera-AutoBC

start crujera-AutoBC

If you have somthing like this:

ensure [addons]

start [addons]

You can just drag and drop to that folder.
